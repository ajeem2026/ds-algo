I believe when it comes to the choice between a stack and a queue, it depends on the type of maze it is traversing.
If I'm aiming for a maze with numerous short and dead-end hallways where the goal state and the start state are 
on the same level, a queue can be more efficient. On the other hand, if it is a maze with a few long dead-end branches, 
a stack can be more efficient.

This decision is similar to choosing between depth-first and breadth-first searching strategies.
In terms of efficiency, I find the stack approach to be more efficient for maze solving. 
When I set a count while testing the maze, the stack method consistently requires fewer attempts to solve the maze, 
and it generally has lower space complexity. Its strength lies in backtracking and deep path exploration.

It's worth noting that the queue approach may have higher space complexity, 
but it can perform better when the start and goal states are on the same level in the search tree. 
In such situations, the queue's memory-intensive approach can be faster.

Therefore, I think there is no concrete answers to these questions and the implementation depends on the context, which is almost
always the case for most computer science problems.
